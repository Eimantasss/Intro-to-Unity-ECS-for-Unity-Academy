# Intro-to-Unity-ECS-for-Unity-Academy

Here I will create a simple demo in which I will show the benefits in game performance using Entity Component System

This example will exhibit a scene full of game objects. So much of them that it barely runs. Another scene will (hopefully) run a lot smoother thanks to the ECS. And some Jobs, if I am able to implement them.
